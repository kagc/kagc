Whether it's drawing, crafting, or coding, I love making projects come to life.  Between digital and traditional art, baking, sewing, crochet, I've found that if a craft interests me, there is nothing I cannot teach myself and enjoy.  With my experiences in the medical field, I've learned to transfer my critical thinking, collaborative, and adaptability skills as a software engineer, and I'd like to consider myself a keen debugging queen on a screened machine. But I believe there is always room to learn, grow, and improve, and I strive to do just that everyday!

As a full stack software developer, I have enjoyed using Python, JavaScript, React/Redux, SQL, HTML, and CSS in my projects. I'm always looking for ways to make something new!
Currently, I'm self learning C++ and in the planning stages of making my own video game.
